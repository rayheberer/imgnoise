# imgnoise

Currently, the four types of noise supported are Gaussian, Salt and Pepper, Speckle, and Uniform Noise.

## Installation

You can install imgnoise from github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("rayheberer/imgnoise")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to implement gaussian noise.

```{r example}
## Loading an image
library(png)
logo = readPNG(system.file("img", "Rlogo.png", package="png")) 
## Applying Noise
imgnoise(logo, "gaussian", variance = 0.5)
```
LogoGaussianVarPoint5.png is the result, and you can extrapolate these to the other example-pngs in example-pngs.
